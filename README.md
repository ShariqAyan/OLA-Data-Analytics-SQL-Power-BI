# Ola-Data-Analytics-SQL-Power-BI

## Project Overview
This project involves comprehensive analysis of Ola ride booking data to derive actionable insights on ride success rates, cancellations, customer behavior, revenue, and ratings. SQL was used for data querying and transformation, while Power BI was leveraged to design interactive dashboards, delivering an end-to-end data analytics solution.

## Project Workflow

- Requirement Gathering – Identified and defined key business KPIs and metrics.

- Data Generation & Exploration – Created and explored a dataset of 100K+ booking records with detailed ride attributes.

- SQL Analysis – Developed queries to analyze bookings, cancellations, revenues, and customer ratings.

- Data Cleaning & Modeling – Cleaned, transformed, and structured the dataset for efficient BI reporting.

- Power BI Dashboarding – Built interactive dashboards to track performance and visualize key insights.

- Insights Generation – Extracted actionable insights to optimize operations and improve decision-making.

## Data Fields

- Booking Details – Date, time, booking ID, status, customer ID, vehicle type

- Location Information – Pickup and drop-off points

- Ride Metrics – Vehicle Turnaround Time (VTAT), Customer Turnaround Time (CTAT), ride distance

- Financial Data – Booking value, payment method

- Cancellations – Cancellation details (by driver, by customer) with reasons

- Ratings – Driver ratings, customer ratings

## Tools & Technologies

- SQL – Data querying, business analysis (successful bookings, cancellations, revenue insights)

- Power BI – Interactive dashboards, DAX measures, KPI tracking & performance analysis

- Excel / CSV – Data source for loading into Power BI

## SQL Queries Implemented

✔ Retrieve all successful bookings ✔ Average ride distance per vehicle type ✔ Total cancelled rides (by customer/driver) ✔ Top 5 customers by rides & booking value ✔ Maximum & minimum driver ratings per vehicle type ✔ Revenue by payment method ✔ Customer vs Driver rating comparisons

## Power BI Dashboard Features

- Overall Performance – Total Bookings, Booking Value, Ride Volume Trend
- Vehicle Type Analysis – Booking Value, Distance Travelled, Success Rate
- Revenue Analysis – Revenue by Payment Method, Top Customers, Revenue by Rides
- Cancellations – Breakdown by Customer & Driver with detailed reasons
- Ratings – Driver vs Customer rating comparison by vehicle type
